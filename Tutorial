Here you learn the basics for using MiniExiftool.


== Installation

* Installing the Exiftool command-line application from Phil Harvay
  (see http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/install.html)
* Installing the Ruby library (<code>gem install mini_exiftool</code>)


== First step: Reading metadata

=== A simple example

 require 'rubygems'
 require 'mini_exiftool'

 photo = MiniExiftool.new 'photo.jpg'
 puts photo['DateTimeOriginal']


=== Smart tag names
In the example above we use <code>photo['DateTimeOriginal']</code> to
get the value for the time the photo was taken. But tag names are not
case sensitiv and additional underlines are also irrelevant. So
following expressions are equivalent:
 photo['DateTimeOriginal']
 photo['datetimeoriginal']
 photo['date_time_original']


=== Nicer access via dynamic methods
Using the []-method is the safest way to access to values of tags
(i. e. Self-timer you can only access this way) but the smarter way is
using dynamic method access. You can write:
 photo.datetimeoriginal
 photo.date_time_original
